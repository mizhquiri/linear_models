_How to insert a link_

Here's some text. I like the internet. I use
[google](https://www.google.com/) all the time to do data science.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
sample = rnorm(1000)
mean(sample)
```

_So how can we add subpages_

1. Created yml sitewide
2. Make a copy and update the title

Here's a direct link to the about page: [about](about.html)


I also made a bonus [extra page](extra_page.html)


Point to a relative path on a server with a file:

[about][about.html]

Can you position your image to a different place in the webpage:
<img src = "images/ted.jpg" style=width
